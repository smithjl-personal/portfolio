				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a passionate lifelong learner who is currently working as a Senior
					Full-Stack Software Developer. I see something new or interesing, like a new
					language or framework, then I build a project in it for fun!
				</p>
				<p>
					This website for example, was created because I realized I didn't really have
					anywhere to show off what I can do. It is written in raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
					along with some <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> icons. You
					can inspect the source code for it
					<a href="https://github.com/smithjl-personal/portfolio">here</a> if you are
					curious.

					<h2>The Game of Life</h2>
					<p>
						This is a game John Conway came up with in 1970. The game has a two
						dimensional grid of live/dead cells, and each cell interacts with its eight
						neighbors. There are only four rules in the game. See the demo or
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Rules"
							>the wiki page</a
						>
						for more detail.
					</p>
					<p>
						With only these four rules, incredible things can happen. This is a
						beautiful example of <i>emergence</i>; where complex or intricate systems
						can arise from simple ones. In other words, the whole is greater than the
						sum of its parts.
					</p>
					<p>
						I created this with <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> to help draw on
						the canvas, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for styling
						some of the controls, and raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the rest. Check out
						the site, a live demo is available.

					<h2>Chess Engine</h2>
					<p>
						I have heard many good things about
						<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> (the programming language). I
						decided I needed to see what the hype was for myself. I also happen to have
						a passion for chess. So the only logical thing to do was learn Rust and
						build a chess engine from scratch! The bot is playing as black in the
						images.
					</p>
					<p>
						The engine uses bitboards, alpha-beta pruning, zobrist-hashes, lookup
						tables, iterative deepening, and many more features. It also interacts with
						the Lichess Bot API; so the engine can be played against on their site with
						their UI. The engine is also asynchronous, so it can play multiple games at
						once.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sadly the bot is not running 24/7 because, well, servers aren't cheap. I'm
						happy to run the bot on my machine for anyone interested in facing it
						though! But the readme in the repository provides details on how to run the
						bot with other accounts if needed.
